# Welcome to the DANTION Cloud Computing

## Prototype Architecture of DANTION Cloud Computing
<img src="https://github.com/C22-PS121/cloud-computing/blob/main/assets/system.drawio.png">

#### GCP Service :
* Google Cloud Storage
* Google BigQuery
* Google App Engine
 
## The role of cloud computing in DANTION

- Google Cloud Storage to save records and profile photo.
- Big query to save all information data.
- We use app engine built with Node.js Express, used to fetching API from mobile apps.
- All code we use Node.js programming languages.

## Getting Started

### Requirements
* Google Account.
* Credit or Debit card to buy GCP credits.
* Add your teammates to join your GCP at this [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqMGmRhKsnM) 

You can claim your free-trial $300 tutorial [here](https://k21academy.com/google-cloud/create-google-cloud-free-tier-account/). <br>
If you have an GCP coupon, you can redeem at [here](https://console.cloud.google.com/trygcp).<br>
Your mobile apps friends need to use Google Maps API. You can follow this tutorial [here](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android-sdk/start#set_up_in_cloud_console).<br>
You must to be wisely when enable each API at GCP,only turn on what is needed.

### Google Cloud Storage
1. Prepare The Google Cloud Storage Bucket, this [tutorial](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/creating-buckets?hl=en).
2. Set permission The Google Cloud Storage Bucket, this [tutorial](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/access-control/iam-roles).
3. Add The Google Cloud Storage to your file Node.js Express to require storage, this [tutorial](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/flexible/nodejs/using-cloud-storage).

### Google BigQuery
1. Open Google BigQuery.
2. Create dataset, this [tutorial](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/datasets?hl=en).
3. Create tables schema, this [tutorial](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/tables).
4. Add The Google BigQuery to your file Node.js Express, this [tutorial](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/cloud-bigquery-nodejs).

### Google App Engine
After Google Cloud Storage and Google BigQuery services step is finished, deploy Google App Engine with Node.js. this [tutorial](https://cloud.google.com/endpoints/docs/openapi/get-started-app-engine#endpoints_configure).
